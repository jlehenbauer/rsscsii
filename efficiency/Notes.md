# Efficiency Notes and Assignments

##### _4/1/21_
[Research "big O" notation.][1]

##### _4/12/21_
Finish `insertion_sort` and begin working on `selection_sort`. 
Note: There is a gif of selection sort in the gifs folder. Feel free to research as needed to complete either function.

##### _4/13/21_
Finish `insertion_sort` (sort.py). Figure out why it is currently only returning two numbers, and figure out how we can make it evaluate and return the entire (sorted) list.

Optional: Begin `bubble_sort` (found in the gifs folder).
