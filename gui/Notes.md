Play around with tkinter! There are some good [tutorials for the buttons and items here][1].

Polish your piglatin program!
Consider:
 - Can you be clear with the user about what exactly they need to do?
 - Can you use language on your button label to be specific about what it's doing?
 - Can you make your code "cleaner"?
 - Can you add comments to your code for anyone who might come along to make edits?
 - Can you add a second translator???

##### _4/26/21_
Use [this tutorial][2] to start using `frame`s and `grid`s to help keep your layout clean!
